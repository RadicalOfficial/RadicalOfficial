## Hello there!
I am a 16 year old video game developer who is working on a lot of things.

## More Info
Currently, I am banned on Scratch. Permanently. But I am working on something else in a different game engine (Godot)! The game is called **The Adventures of Caseoh** and it will release soon.
<br>I made SimGarden, a clone of SimCity from the SNES. Play it here for free: https://knightbot63.itch.io/gardensim<br>
You never know, I might put my soundtrack here!
